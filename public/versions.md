# Versions

There are two stable versions of the Public API: the Public API v1 and the Public API v2.

When using the Public API v1, we encourage you to request v1 via the `API-Version: 1` header. Similarly, use `API-Version: 2` to request API v2.

## Deprecated versions

- We removed support for API v1 on June 14, 2018.
